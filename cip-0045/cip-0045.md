## Abstract

* A few differently weighted SVs are currently camping out of the GSF multitenant instead
of running their own SV
* A series of SV CIPs recently passed giving low weighted SVs the right to use the GSF
multitenant for 6 months but many of those parties are not experienced operators and
the network wouldn’t benefit materially from forcing them to contract to run an SV
* This CIP proposes a 2.5 SV weight threshold above which an SV must begin to operate
their own SV or risk forfeiting their Weighting or their right to be an SV

## Motivation

* The GSF multitenant is creating a bit of a freerider problem and it would be beneficial to
set some rules around its utilization
* The SVs have signalled there is a preference to require some to run their SVs over
letting in arbitrary operators to the quorum
* This CIP seeks to set the threshold at which one must run their own SV

## Proposed Changes 

* Any SV with a Reward Weight greater than 2.5 must operate their own SV within 6
months of crossing the 2.5 Weight threshold or, if already over Weight 2.5, within 6
months of this CIP passing
* SVs in violation of this rule will have an opportunity to plead their case before any vote to
address the violation
* The SVs will raise a vote to address any SV in violation of this rule after the 6 month
grace period by reducing the violating SV’s reward weight down to 1. The large reduction
is to account for the extended period of over earning vs their commitment to the Network
